### Breaking changes

In the prior releases, `AzureEventHubHealthCheck` was a part of `AspNetCore.Pulse.AzureServiceBus` package. It had a dependency on not just `Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus`, but also `Azure.Messaging.EventHubs`. The packages have been split to avoid bringing unnecessary dependencies. The name of the new EveHub package is [AspNetCore.Pulse.Azure.Messaging.EventHubs](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AspNetCore.Pulse.Azure.Messaging.EventHubs).
